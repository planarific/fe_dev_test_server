# Front-end developer test server: API

The server implements an extremely simple API with the following endpoints:

## /v1/health

TOKEN required: **no**

This is a simple healthcheck endpoint, to check whether the container is running.

Example request:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer SUPERSECRETTOKEN" https://fedevtest.azurewebsites.net/v1/health
```

Example response:

```
Everything is OK
```

## /v1/models

TOKEN required: **yes**

Fetch a list of "models" (buildings, dwellings).

*NB* you should not make any assumptions about the order in which models are returned, or infer any correlation between a model's ID and the path to its thumbnail image. These can and will change on a regular basis.

Example request:
```
 curl -H "Authorization: Bearer SUPERSECRETTOKEN" https://fedevtest.azurewebsites.net/v1/models
```

Example response:

```

  },

    "id": 9,
    "description": "6 Regent Court GU19 5QD",
    "thumbnail": "/thumbs/9.png"
  }
]
```

## /v1/models/:id

TOKEN required: **yes**

Fetch detailed information about an individual "model" (building, dwelling). The parameter `id` should match one of the IDs returned by the `/v1/models/` endpoint.

*NB* you should not assume any correlation between a model's ID and the path to its thumbnail image or model data. These can and will change on a regular basis.

Example request:
```
 curl -H "Authorization: Bearer SUPERSECRETTOKEN" https://fedevtest.azurewebsites.net/v1/models/1
```

Example response:

```

{
  "id": 1,
  "address1": "24 Hesters Way Road",
  "address2": "",
  "city": "Cheltenham",
  "state": "Gloucestershire",
  "postal_code": "GL51 0DA",
  "thumbnail": "/thumbs/1.png",
  "model": "https://planarificfedevtest.blob.core.windows.net/models/house1.glb"
}
```
